# Invasion on Coria Prime

Invasion on Coria Prime is a game I made as my thesis for my Software Engineer BSc. This is the source code of it.

## Installation

You can download the actual game at https://ghost-rose-games.itch.io/invasion-on-coria-prime where you can find the installation manual to it too.

To use this source code, you need the Unity Editor and the 2022.3.50f1 version of Unity installed. You can open it via the Unity Hub, opening it as a project.
